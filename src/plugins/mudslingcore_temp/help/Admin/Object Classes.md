lock: perm(create objects)

Every object in the game world is of one type or another. These types are referred to as "object classes".

A letter object on which you wrote a message to another player might have a class of "Letter", or the necklace object you were given by another player might have a class of "Jewelry". Classes will usually be broad(ish) categories of objects.

A typical game world is probably filled with objects of classes Room, Character, etc.
