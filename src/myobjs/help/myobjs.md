title: My Objects
aliases: myobjs
lock: perm(use myobjs)

The "My Objects" (aka "myobjs" or "@myobjs") system allows you to store custom object aliases. By saving a custom alias, you can refer to it at any time, without it having to be in your location for name-based match and without having to remember its object ID.

Commands:

* [[@myobjs]]: List all your object shortcuts.
* [[@myobj]]: Set/delete object shortcuts.
