ANSI codes are character sequences sent by the server and interpreted by
the client to change the color and styling of text. ANSI support is off
by default, but can be turned on using the `@ansi` command.

* **off** - Turns off ANSI color codes.
* **on** - Turns on basic ANSI color codes.
* **256** - Turns on ANSI-256 support, which includes more colors.
