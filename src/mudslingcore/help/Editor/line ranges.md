title: Line Ranges (editor)

Line ranges specify one or more lines in an editor. This is useful when deleting lines or listing only a subset of the lines in an editor.

Syntax: `<start>[-<end>]`

A line range consists of at least a starting line number, followed by an *optional* ending line number. The line numbers can be any [line number](line numbers) expression.
