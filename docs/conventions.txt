Code formatting, naming, etc:
    Use PEP8 in general. Biggest exception is class member naming, for which we
    generally use camelCase, though underscore_names are fine too.

Hooks:
    * Module hooks: hook_name()
    * General event hooks: onEventName()
    * System-only hooks: eventName()
        * For instance: tasks have server_startup(), which is a system-level
          hook that most child classes should not override. This hook in turn
          calls the user-overridable hook: on_server_startup().
