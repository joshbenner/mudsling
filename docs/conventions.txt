Code formatting, naming, etc:
    Use PEP8 in general. Exceptions are allowed, but keep them minimal and 
    sensible.

Hooks:
    * Module hooks: hook_name()
    * General event hooks: on_event_name()
    * System-only hooks: event_name()
        * For instance: tasks have server_startup(), which is a system-level
          hook that most child classes should not override. This hook in turn
          calls the user-overridable hook: on_server_startup().

Time handling:
    * Any stored UNIX time should be a proper UTC timestamp. Use time.time().
    * Any stored datetime should be aware. Use mudsling.utils.time.make_aware().
